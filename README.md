# Second Assignment of the Research Track 2 course (Robotics_5051520 Engineering Unige)

The package contains the nodes and the simulation environment for controlling a mobile robot in the Gazebo simulation environment and jupyter notebook to have a graphical userinterface and control the robot through it.
- To launch the gazebo node, please run:
```
roslaunch rt2_assignment1 sim.launch
```
- To launch the jupyter notebook run the commands below:
``` jupyter notebook --allow-root ``` and open the notebook named as jupyter_5051520.ipynb.

## Doxygen documentation:
* Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular programming languages such as C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, VHDL and to some extent D.It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (in $\mbox{\LaTeX}$) from a set of documented source files. There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code.usig command ***doxywizard*** we select the file location output need to be attained.
* Doxygen documentation is done for the **go_to_point.py**,**user_interface.py**,**state_machine.cpp** and **position_service.cpp** and and the attained in the form of HTML,LATEX.
### Here ae some sample HTML outputs:
