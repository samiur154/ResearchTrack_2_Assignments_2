 *  Description :
 *  
 *  This node implements the state machine for the input to be provided by the user 
 *  to control the holonomic robot. It includes:
 *  - An Action client "go_to_point" that interacts with the action
 *    "Planning" to:
 * 		- set a new goal randomly when the user presses 1 to start 
 * 		- check if the goal has been reached by the robot
 * 		- check if the goal has been cancelled,when the user presses 0 to stop the robot
 * 		- Define the new state
 *  - A Service server that advertise the command line user interface
* 	- A Service client that requires a new target postion from the 
* 		/position_server

 * description:
 *    The main function, define all the initializations as follows:
 * 
 *    client_rp: it is used for  getting a random goal at custom service RandomPosition
 *    goal_position: the random goal generated as a Position Goal and send it to /go_to_point node
 *    service: it is read the command which is sent by the user from the Command service custom message
 * 
 *    After initializations it generates a request for the random position in interval [-5, 5], then executes an infinite loop 
 *    in which it gets the random position and sends it as a goal position to the /go_to_point node and waits untill
 *    the target is reached. In case in which the command from /user_interface is "stop" (so start==false) so that the goal is cancelled
 *    and the robot is stopped, otherwise the loop is executed again.
